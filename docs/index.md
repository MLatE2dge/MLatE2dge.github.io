# Machine Learning @ the Extreme Edge

<div style="text-align: justify">One of the challenges today is <b>real-time and energy-efficient information extraction and processing at the edge</b> by using Artificial Intelligence. However, there is a recent trend to implement <b>machine learning on end-point devices</b>. These end-point devices are located on the <b>extreme edge</b>, the border between the analog (physical world) and the digital world. They consist of one or more sensors and a resource-constrained embedded device, a device with a limited amount of memory, computing power and power consumption. <b>Today's challenge is to develop accurate, energy-efficient machine learning models that can be deployed on these end-point devices</b>.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify"> <b>Machine Learning at the Extreme Edge (ML@E2dge) looks at how a developer can apply machine learning in the development of accurate, energy-efficient, and intelligent (wireless) (battery-powered) end-point devices and systems</b>. Starting from a case study (estimation of spatio-temporal parameters), a machine learning model is developed, optimized and deployed. In the project, we limit ourselves to a supervised machine learning regression problem. In the project open-source software frameworks such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow and Keras are used, in combination with Edge Impulse Studio. For experiment tracking, the MLOps tool Weights and Biases  is used.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify"> The outcome of the project is a data- and machine learning pipeline (workflow) that illustrates how to solve a embedded machine learning problem.</div>
