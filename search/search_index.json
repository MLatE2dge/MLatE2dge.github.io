There is a recent trend to implement machine learning (ML) on end-point devices. These end-point devices are located on the extreme edge: the border between the analog, physical world, and the digital world. Such a device consists of one or more sensors and a resource-constrained embedded device, a device with a limited amount of memory, computing power and power consumption. Today's challenge is to develop accurate, energy-efficient machine learning models. This can be achieved by tiny machine learning, a sub-field in the machine learning. Machine Learning at the Extreme Edge (ML@E2dge) looks at how a developer can apply tiny machine learning in the development of an accurate, energy-efficient, and intelligent wireless battery-powered monitoring system. Starting from a case study, a tiny machine learning model is developed, optimized, deployed. In the project, we limit ourselves to a supervised machine learning regression problem. The end-point device is a Cortex\u00ae-M4 ARM\u00ae microcontroller (nRF52840, Nordic Semiconductor), in combination with an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensor (MTi-3, Xsens). Open-source software frameworks such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow and Keras are used, in combination with Edge Impulse Studio. For the experiment, metrics and version tracking, MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) frameworks such as ml flow and Weights and Biases are explored.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#mle2dge","text":"One of the challenges is real-time and energy-efficient information extraction and processing at the edge by using AI.
