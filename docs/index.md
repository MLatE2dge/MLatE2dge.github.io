<div style="text-align: justify"> <b>Machine Learning at the Extreme Edge (ML@E2dge)</b> looks at how we can apply tinyML (tiny machine learning) in the development of an accurate, energy-efficient, and intelligent wireless battery-powered monitoring system. By using a healthcare application, we demonstrate the potential of the tinyML technology. In addition, we bring the tinyML technology to the developers. Make developers aware of the existence and possibilities of the technology. A technology that allows developers to design intelligent devices. We also investigate, from the viewpoint of a user, the needed requirements for future monitoring systems. </div>
