However, there is a recent trend to implement machine learning on end-point devices . These end-point devices are located on the extreme edge , the border between the analog (physical world) and the digital world. They consist of one or more sensors and a resource-constrained embedded device, a device with a limited amount of memory, computing power and power consumption. Today's challenge is to develop accurate, energy-efficient machine learning models that can be deployed on these end-point devices . Machine Learning at the Extreme Edge (ML@E2dge) looks at how a developer can apply machine learning in the development of accurate, energy-efficient, and intelligent (wireless) (battery-powered) end-point devices and systems . Starting from a case study (estimation of spatio-temporal parameters), a machine learning model is developed, optimized and deployed. In the project, we limit ourselves to a supervised machine learning regression problem. In the project open-source software frameworks such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow and Keras are used, in combination with Edge Impulse Studio. For experiment tracking, the MLOps tool Weights and Biases is used. The outcome of the project is a data- and machine learning pipeline (workflow) that illustrates how to solve a embedded machine learning problem.
